# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Philly converter

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
We want to create a Philly based dictionary to help Temple students who are not Philly natives.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Our project is job is to aid non-philly natives to become acqumulated with the philly based slang.We will allow the user to translate from plain english into philly slang. The user should be allowed to add in words that they learned and it can not be found in the program. We will use python idle to run the program.We will have a quiz mode so the user can test their knowledge on the slang.Also, we will use a series of while loops, dictionaries, and other methods learned in this course.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course? N/A

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO We would like the program to succesfully store the user's input into the dictionary.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
We would like the user's input to be stored and added to the dictionary. We believe we will be able to accomplish this before the ginal project's deadline.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We would like the quiz portion of the quiz to successfully give the user randomized questions while keeping track of the score. The score does not necessarily need to be printed on the screen.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We need to learn how to successfully create a main menu. We want the user to be able to successfully pick what they would like to do when on the app.Moreover, we need to practice nesting our loops to successfully run this program. Semir will be responsible for brainstorming methods on how the user will add items to the dictionary and the possible words we will have stored. Jessica will be responsible for creating a quiz for the users and allowing the user to see what is stored in the dictionary. It is still work so when will both offer input in all aspects of the program.
